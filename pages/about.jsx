                I value sustainability and accessibility. I believe we human
                beings need to have more compassion to our earth ðŸŒŽ and to each
                other in order to face the big challenge in front of us.

                I am constantly in awe by nature and love to explore the world.
                I also enjoy volunteering and contribute to local communities.
                <br />
                <br />
                In my spare time, I like to practice muay thai, jog and go to
                beautiful places to document street art.
